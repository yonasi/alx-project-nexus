## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
The program introduced me to a robust stack of tools and technologies essential for modern backend development. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

- **Python**:
  - Mastered core Python concepts like data structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
  - Explored **asynchronous programming** using `async/await` for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., API calls), which improved my understanding of concurrency.
  - Learned **generators** for memory-efficient iteration, **decorators** for code reuse (e.g., timing functions), and **context managers** for resource management (e.g., file handling with `with` statements).
  - Example: Wrote a decorator to log execution time of database queries, which helped debug performance bottlenecks.

- **Django & Django REST Framework (DRF)**:
  - Built web applications using Django’s MVC framework, leveraging its **ORM** for database interactions.
  - Used DRF to create RESTful APIs with serializers, views, and routers for clean endpoint design.
  - Implemented **JWT authentication** to secure APIs and **DRF permissions** for role-based access (e.g., restricting endpoint access to authenticated users).
  - Explored **Django middleware** for request/response processing and **signals** for event-driven actions (e.g., sending notifications on user creation).
  - Example: Created a `/users/` endpoint with DRF to register and authenticate users, secured with JWT tokens.

- **REST APIs**:
  - Designed RESTful APIs adhering to HTTP standards (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes (200, 404, etc.).
  - Learned to structure endpoints for scalability and maintainability (e.g., `/api/v1/resource/`).
  - Example: Built a simple API for a to-do list app with endpoints like `/tasks/` and `/tasks/{id}/`.

- **GraphQL**:
  - Introduced to GraphQL as a flexible alternative to REST, focusing on schema design and query resolution.
  - Used Graphene-Django to create a basic GraphQL API, learning how to query nested data efficiently.
  - Example: Implemented a GraphQL query to fetch user profiles with related posts in a single request, reducing over-fetching compared to REST.

- **Relational Databases**:
  - Worked with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** for data storage.
  - Learned **database schema design** principles like normalization and indexing.
  - Practiced **SQL** for CRUD operations and **advanced query optimization** using EXPLAIN plans and indexes.
  - Example: Optimized a slow query fetching user activity logs by adding an index on the `created_at` column, reducing query time by 60%.

- **Docker & Kubernetes**:
  - Containerized applications using **Docker** to ensure consistent environments across development and production.
  - Learned **Kubernetes** basics for orchestrating containers, including pods, deployments, and services.
  - Example: Dockerized a Django app with a PostgreSQL database and deployed it locally using Minikube to simulate a Kubernetes cluster.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - Set up **continuous integration/continuous deployment** pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions.
  - Automated testing and deployment processes to streamline development workflows.
  - Example: Configured a GitHub Actions workflow to run Pytest on every push and deploy to a staging environment on successful tests.

- **Testing**:
  - Used **Pytest** for unit and integration testing, ensuring code reliability.
  - Wrote tests for API endpoints, database queries, and authentication flows.
  - Example: Tested a DRF endpoint to ensure only authenticated users could create resources, catching a bug in permission settings.

- **Other Tools**:
  - Learned **shell scripting** for automating tasks (e.g., database backups).
  - Used **SSH** for secure server access and configuration.
  - Implemented **background jobs** with Celery for tasks like sending emails or processing data asynchronously.
  - Example: Set up a Celery task to send a welcome email to new users after registration.

### Important Backend Development Concepts
The program emphasized foundational concepts that form the backbone of scalable backend systems:

- **Database Design**:
  - Learned to design normalized schemas to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity.
  - Understood relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) and used Django ORM to model them.
  - Example: Designed a schema for a blog app with `Post`, `Comment`, and `User` tables, using foreign keys and indexes for performance.

- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Grasped `async/await` for handling I/O-bound tasks like API requests or database queries.
  - Example: Refactored a file upload endpoint to use `async` for faster processing of large files.

- **Caching Strategies**:
  - Introduced to caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.
  - Still learning advanced caching patterns like cache invalidation, but practiced basic caching with Django’s cache framework.
  - Example: Cached frequently accessed API responses (e.g., a list of top posts) to reduce query execution time.

- **Error Handling & Logging**:
  - Implemented try-except blocks and custom exceptions for robust error handling.
  - Used Python’s `logging` module and Django’s logging framework to track application behavior.
  - Example: Added logging to capture failed login attempts, helping identify a bug in JWT token validation.

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Learned secure authentication with JWT and OAuth principles.
  - Implemented role-based access control using DRF permissions.
  - Example: Restricted an API endpoint to admin users only, using DRF’s `IsAdminUser` permission class.

- **Container Orchestration**:
  - Understood Kubernetes concepts like pods, services, and deployments for scalable applications.
  - Example: Deployed a Django app in a Kubernetes pod with a PostgreSQL service, learning to configure environment variables.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
As a beginner, I encountered several hurdles but overcame them through research, practice, and iteration:

- **Challenge**: Advanced query optimization in PostgreSQL was difficult, especially understanding query plans and indexing.
  - **Solution**: Studied PostgreSQL’s `EXPLAIN` command via the official docs and created indexes on frequently queried columns. Practiced on a sample dataset to reduce query times, gaining confidence in optimization techniques.

- **Challenge**: Setting up Docker and Kubernetes felt overwhelming due to unfamiliar concepts like Dockerfiles and YAML configurations.
  - **Solution**: Followed Docker’s “Get Started” tutorial and used Minikube to experiment locally. Broke down Kubernetes setup into smaller steps (e.g., creating a pod, then a deployment), which made it more manageable.

- **Challenge**: GraphQL’s schema design and resolver logic were harder to grasp compared to REST’s straightforward endpoints.
  - **Solution**: Built a small GraphQL API with Graphene-Django to query a simple dataset (e.g., users and posts). Compared it to a REST equivalent to understand trade-offs, which clarified GraphQL’s flexibility.

- **Challenge**: Writing comprehensive tests with Pytest took time, as I wasn’t sure what to test initially.
  - **Solution**: Focused on testing critical paths (e.g., API endpoints, authentication flows) using DRF’s `APIClient`. Watched online tutorials on TDD to prioritize test cases, improving my testing workflow.

- **Challenge**: Configuring CI/CD pipelines required understanding new tools like GitHub Actions.
  - **Solution**: Started with a basic workflow to run Pytest on commits, then added deployment steps. Referred to GitHub Actions documentation and community examples to troubleshoot syntax errors.

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
The program taught me not just technical skills but also professional habits for backend development:

- **Write Clean, Modular Code**: Breaking code into reusable functions and classes (e.g., Django views, DRF serializers) improves maintainability and readability.
- **Use Version Control Effectively**: Committing small, logical changes with clear messages (e.g., `Add JWT auth to user endpoints`) makes collaboration and debugging easier.
- **Test Early and Often**: Adopting test-driven development (TDD) catches bugs early. Writing tests for edge cases (e.g., invalid API inputs) ensures robustness.
- **Document Everything**: Clear API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI makes APIs user-friendly. Inline code comments and a detailed README improve project accessibility.
- **Start Simple, Iterate Later**: For complex topics like Kubernetes or GraphQL, starting with minimal setups (e.g., a single pod, a basic query) builds confidence before tackling advanced features.
- **Continuous Learning is Key**: Topics like caching, async programming, and Kubernetes require ongoing practice. I’m excited to explore these further in my final project.
- **Personal Takeaway**: Backend development is about solving problems systematically—balancing functionality, performance, and scalability. As a beginner, focusing on small, achievable goals builds momentum and confidence.

## Final Project: Online Poll System Backend
For my final project, I’m building a backend for an **Online Poll System** using Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, and Docker. This project will consolidate my skills in:
- Designing a database schema for polls, questions, and votes.
- Building RESTful APIs with DRF for creating, viewing, and voting on polls.
- Securing endpoints with JWT authentication and DRF permissions.
- Writing unit and integration tests with Pytest.
- Containerizing the app with Docker and deploying it with Kubernetes.
- Optionally, implementing a GraphQL endpoint for querying poll results and a Celery background job for tasks like sending vote confirmation emails.

This project is ideal for my skill level because it focuses on CRUD operations, authentication, and deployment—core concepts from the program—while allowing me to explore advanced topics like GraphQL and background jobs at my own pace.
