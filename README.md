## Overview
The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is a three-month intensive course designed to equip learners with foundational and intermediate skills in backend development. Through hands-on projects and theoretical lessons, I explored key backend technologies, concepts, and best practices. This repository serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings, challenges faced, and personal takeaways from the program.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Python**: Learned core Python programming, including asynchronous programming with `async/await`, generators, decorators, and context managers for efficient code structuring and resource management.
- **Django & Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Built web applications and RESTful APIs using Django’s ORM, middleware, signals, and DRF for authentication (JWT), permissions, and serialization.
- **REST APIs**: Designed and implemented RESTful APIs with endpoints for CRUD operations, focusing on scalability and proper HTTP methods/status codes.
- **GraphQL**: Explored GraphQL as an alternative to REST, learning schema design and query resolution for flexible data fetching.
- **Databases**: Worked with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite), focusing on schema design, SQL queries, and advanced query optimization.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerized applications using Docker and orchestrated them with Kubernetes for deployment and scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Testing**: Used Pytest for unit and integration testing to ensure code reliability.
- **Other Tools**: Learned shell scripting, SSH for remote server management, and background job processing with tools like Celery.

### Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design**: Mastered creating efficient database schemas, normalizing data, and optimizing queries to reduce latency and improve performance.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Understood `async/await` for handling I/O-bound tasks, improving application responsiveness in high-concurrency scenarios.
- **Caching Strategies**: Explored caching (though not fully mastered) to reduce database load and improve API response times.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Implemented robust error handling and logging to debug and monitor applications effectively.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Learned secure user authentication (JWT) and role-based permissions using DRF.
- **Container Orchestration**: Gained introductory knowledge of Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
- **Challenge**: Struggled with advanced query optimization in PostgreSQL, especially indexing and joins.
  - **Solution**: Studied EXPLAIN plans and practiced indexing strategies, referring to PostgreSQL documentation and online tutorials.
- **Challenge**: Configuring Docker and Kubernetes for the first time was overwhelming due to unfamiliar terminology.
  - **Solution**: Followed Docker’s official tutorials and used Minikube to experiment with Kubernetes locally, breaking down complex setups into smaller steps.
- **Challenge**: Understanding GraphQL’s schema and resolver logic compared to REST APIs.
  - **Solution**: Built a small GraphQL API with Graphene-Django, comparing it to equivalent REST endpoints to clarify differences.
- **Challenge**: Writing comprehensive unit tests with Pytest was initially time-consuming.
  - **Solution**: Focused on testing critical paths first (e.g., API endpoints) and used DRF’s test client to simplify API testing.

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
- **Modular Code**: Writing clean, modular Python code with clear function/class responsibilities improves maintainability.
- **Version Control**: Using Git for version control and maintaining a clean commit history is crucial for collaboration and tracking changes.
- **Testing Early**: Writing tests alongside code (TDD) catches bugs early and builds confidence in deployments.
- **Documentation**: Clear API documentation (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger with DRF) is essential for usability.
- **Continuous Learning**: Some topics (e.g., Kubernetes, caching) require ongoing practice. I plan to deepen my understanding through my final project (an Online Poll System backend).
- **Takeaway**: Backend development is about balancing functionality, performance, and scalability. Starting simple and iterating is key for beginners.

## Next Steps
For my final project, I’m building a backend for an **Online Poll System** using Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, and Docker. This will consolidate my skills in REST APIs, authentication, testing, and containerization while allowing me to explore GraphQL and background jobs further.
